        <p>I came all the way to OHS through the Second Chance Program. My history is a mystery and my friends here do not know much about me yet! It is unknown if I have ever lived with other animals or children.
I am eager to learn and a Basic Manners class may be just the right thing for us!
I really enjoy playing with toys! I’ll let you know my favorite one when we meet!
I am treat motivated! You can use treats to teach me new things!
I am excitable and energetic! I will need plenty of positive outlets for my energy!</p>

I have lived with cats in my last home.
I don’t always like to share my food, toys or bedding with other animals or people.
I can get worried when I am left alone.</p>
